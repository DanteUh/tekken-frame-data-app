# Tekken 7 Frame Data App

## About
Welcome to a fan made Tekken 7 frame data application.

I started this project mainly because I was tierd with how Tekken 7 frame data was presented on other sites. The goal of the app is to make it easier to search for specfic moves, data and get a better understanding of what that data represents.
